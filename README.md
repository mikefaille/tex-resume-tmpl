# A LaTeX resume template

`resumeNuage.cls` (filename will be corrected in futur commits) is a document class that adds name and address information to the
head of the document and provides resume section and subsection environments
(`rSection` and `rSubsection`).  The address separator format, the
`rSubsection` heading format, and the skip sizes defined in `resume.cls` can be
customized.
